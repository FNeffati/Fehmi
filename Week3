#Write a number guessing game. You should pick a number (assign it to a varaible in your code) and then repeatedly ask the user to guess the number. Tell the user is their guess is too high or too low, and end when the user correctly guesses your number.
#6) Modify your guessing game so that it counts the number of tries that it takes the user to correclty guess the number.
#7) It is kind of stupid to have to pick a number and write it in your code. In particular, this means that if you want to play the game more than once, you need to actually go and change the code ... Also, if the user sees your code, they will know exaclty what to guess.
#A better way is to have Python pick a random number. By default, Python doesn't know how to pick a random number. Fortunately, someone already put together an explanation of how to pick random numbers, we can add this new capability to Python by "importing" the instructions that someone else wrote.

d = random.randint(1,100)
count = 1 
while gs != d:
  gs = int(input('Guess a number between 1-100: '))
  if (gs == d):   
    print("Congrats! Nice guess.")

  else:
    if gs < (d + 5) or gs < (d-5):
      print('warm')
    if gs > (d + 5) or gs > (d-5):
      print('cold')
    print( "try again.")
    count += 1


print("it took you " + str (count) + " guesses.")

#8) You could modify your guessing game to say "getting closer" or "getting further away" (i.e., "warmer" or "colder") instead of "Too High" or "Too Low"

d = random.randint(1,100)
current = int(input("Guess a number between 1 and 100: "))
if current == d:
  print("Congrats! Nice guess.")
else:
  while current != d:
    old = current
    current = int(input("Enter a new guess: "))

    if current == d:
      print("Congrats! Nice guess.")
    elif abs(d - old) > abs(d - current):
      print("You are getting warmer, keep trying: ")
    elif abs(d - old) < abs(d - current):
